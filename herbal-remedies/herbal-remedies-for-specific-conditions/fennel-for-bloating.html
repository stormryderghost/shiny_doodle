            <h1>Relieve Bloating with Fennel</h1>
            <p>Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is a versatile herb renowned for its digestive benefits. It has been used traditionally to alleviate bloating, gas, and other digestive discomforts. This herb is rich in essential oils, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory compounds that contribute to its therapeutic effects.</p>

            <h2>Health Benefits of Fennel</h2>
            <p>Fennel seeds have a carminative effect, meaning they help to expel gas from the digestive tract, reducing bloating and discomfort. The herb's antispasmodic properties can also help relieve cramping and digestive spasms.</p>
            <p>In addition to its digestive benefits, fennel is a good source of fiber, which supports healthy digestion and regular bowel movements. Its antioxidant content helps protect the digestive system from oxidative stress and inflammation.</p>

            <h2>How to Use Fennel for Digestive Health</h2>
            <p>There are several ways to incorporate fennel into your diet:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fennel Tea:</strong> Steep 1-2 teaspoons of fennel seeds in boiling water for 10 minutes. Strain and drink after meals to help with digestion. <a href="#tea-recipe">Read more about fennel tea preparation</a>.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2 id="tea-recipe">Fennel Tea Recipe</h2>
            <p>To make fennel tea:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil 1 cup of water.</li>
                <li>Add 1-2 teaspoons of fennel seeds.</li>
                <li>Let it steep for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Strain the seeds and pour the tea into a cup.</li>
                <li>Optionally, add honey or lemon for flavor.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="seed-dosage">Dosage of Fennel Seeds</h2>
            <p>The typical dosage of fennel seeds is 1 teaspoon per day. Consuming more than this amount can lead to digestive discomfort. Always start with a smaller amount and gradually increase as needed.</p>

            <h2 id="oil-application">Using Fennel Oil</h2>
            <p>Fennel essential oil should be used with caution. Dilute 2-3 drops of fennel oil in a carrier oil (such as coconut or almond oil) before applying it to the abdomen. Perform a patch test to ensure there is no allergic reaction.</p>

            <h2 id="recipes">Fennel Recipes</h2>
